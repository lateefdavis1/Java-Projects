------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constant interest rate = %5;

Constant initial balance = $1,000.00;

Constant balance = initial balance; //reference variable for initial balance

//For loop that iterates through the provided number of years

For each year

The initial balance of $10,000 will have %5 interest applied annually 

Output the number of years entered with the interest rate applied towards the initial balance
